# Chat Bot

This is a very simple chat bot inspired by:

- (Berkeley project)[http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/projects/bonniejc.pdf]
- (Stackexchange thread)[http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/20914/who-is-this-chatbot]


How to use:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rgeos/chat.git`
2. Inside the cloned directory run `./main.py`

The database will be populated with words and sentences used in the conversation
